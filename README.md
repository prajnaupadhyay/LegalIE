# LegalIE

## Run the code

Python 3.10 is needed to run the code.

### Set-up

1. `conda create -n legalIE python=3.10`

2. `conda activate legalIE`

3. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Training and Prediction

`python run.py train-test <training_data_file> <model_directory> <test_data_file> <prediction_file> <model_name> <batch_size> <seed>`

1. You can only use `train` or `test` instead of `train-test` if you want to do these steps individually.
2. `<training_data_file>` is are located in the `input/` folder of datasets which are located in `data/`.
3. `<model_directory>` is the location where the fine-tuned model will be saved after training and the re-trained (and finetuned) model located here will be used to generate predictions during testing.
4. `<test_data_file>` are located in the `gold/` folder of datasets which are located in `data/`.
5. `<prediction_file>` is the path where predictions generated by our model will be saved.
6. `<model_name>` will be `T5` or `BART`. The size of the model can changed through code.
7. `<batch_size>` is the batch size used during training. It can be $3, 16, 24, 32$ but $3$ gave the best results in most cases.
8. `<seed>` is a random seed value used for initialization. (We averaged results across 3 runs, this was used for that purpose.)

Please note that `<training_data_file>`, `<model_directory>`, `<test_data_file>` and `<prediction_file>` are relative paths and not just names.

### Evaluation

`python Utils/wire57.py <model_name> <referance_file> <prediction_file>`
1. `<model_name>` is the model used to generate `<prediction_file>`. It can be `T5` or `BART`
2. `<referance_file>` is a file with ground truth for the test dataset. These are located in `gold\` folder of each dataset which are in `data\`
3. `<prediction_file` is a file containing outputs generated by the model. Scores of this file will be calculated.
Please note that `<referance_file>` and `<prediction_file>` are relative paths and not just file names.
