Coordinating sentences join independent
clauses with coordinating conjunctions like ’and’, ’or’, and ’but’, enhancing sentence complexity. Your task is to form independent clauses by identifying the coordinating phrases. 
To construct the hierarchical tree, follow the below steps:

Step 1: Identify the coordinating phrase like 'and', 'or' and 'but'. Sometimes a sentence can have comma as well to distinguish between different words. Consider that as well while forming independent sentences.
Step 2: Join all the dependent phrases of the coordinating phrase to make an independent sentence.   Add context while forming independent sentences. Every sentence should be complete.
Step 3: Loop over all the clauses from step 2, and if there are still coordinating phrases present, repeat steps 1 and step 2 till all the coordinating phrases are identified in the input sentence. The clauses should be completely independent.
Step 4: Repeat steps 1 to 3 till all the subordinating and coordinating phrases in the individual clauses are identified.

Step 5: Do not print the results of intermediate steps; print only the final output. If there are no coordinating phrases in the input sentence, the output will be NONE. Else, the  output of the hierarchical tree in the format :

```COORDINATION('Clause1', Clause2' , COORDINATION('clause', 'clause2').......)```
