 Coordination is a frequently occurring syntactic structure along with several phrases, known as conjuncts.
 The task of coordination disambiguation is identifying the boundaries of each conjunct with a single coordinator word as one coordinate structure instance.
 
Given a coordinator word (e.g., “and,” “or,” or “but”), a system must return each conjunct span if the word actually plays the role of a coordinator; otherwise, NONE is output for the absence of coordination. Here are few examples:
