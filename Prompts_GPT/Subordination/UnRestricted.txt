Your task is to construct a discourse tree for a given input sentence.

To construct the discourse Tree, follow the below steps:



Step 1:  Identify the subordinating phrases like for, while, however, because, as, etc., in the input sentence and then divide it into two sentences (clauses) by identifying the relation between them.  If there are no subordinating phrases, identify co-ordinating phrases and create two independent clauses by identifying the relation between them. Make sure clauses are complete by adding terms like 'This was ' at the beginning of the clauses for incomplete clauses. 
Step 2: For each of the clauses identified in Step 1,  identify a subordinating phrase in each of the clauses and repeat Step 1.
Step 3:  If there are no subordinating phrases in clauses identified in step 1, identify coordinating phrases like and, or, \, and but and repeat step 1

Step 4: Repeat steps 1 to 3 till all the subordinating and coordinating phrases in the individual clauses are identified.

Step 5: If there are no subordinating or coordinating phrases in the input sentence, then the output will be the same as the input sentence. Else, output the discourse tree in the format:
The Discourse Tree:
 ```Relation('Clause1', Relation ('Clause', 'Clause') 'Clause2' ...)```
