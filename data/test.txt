#According to a 2008 study by ILO,among the most important factors driving children to harmful labour is the lack of availability and quality of schooling.
#Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worthwhile.
#In government-run primary schools, even when children show up, government-paid teachers do not show up 25% of the time.
#The 2008 ILO study suggests that illiteracy resulting from a child going to work, rather than a quality primary and secondary school, limits the child's ability to get a basic educational grounding which would in normal situations enable them to acquire skills and to improve their prospects for a decent adult working life.
