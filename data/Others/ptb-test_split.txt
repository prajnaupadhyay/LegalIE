#But while the New York Stock Exchange did n't fall apart Friday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos .
JARGON
#Some circuit breakers installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures .
JARGON
#The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure .
JARGON
#Seven Big Board stocks -- UAL , AMR , BankAmerica , Walt Disney , Capital Cities\/ABC , Philip Morris and Pacific Telesis Group -- stopped trading and never resumed .
JARGON
#Many money managers and some traders had already left their offices early Friday afternoon on a warm autumn day -- because the stock market was so quiet .
JARGON
#Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume .
JARGON
#In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday .
JARGON
#Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group .
JARGON
#Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators , or risk arbitragers , had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise .
JARGON
#And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group could n't get financing for its bid .
JARGON
#Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every rumor stock they had .
JARGON
#For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , Delta Air Lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and Philips Industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 .
JARGON
#But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses .
JARGON
#Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago .
JARGON
#After the trading halt in the S&P 500 pit in Chicago , waves of selling continued to hit stocks themselves on the Big Board , and specialists continued to notch prices down .
JARGON
#As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart .
JARGON
#This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings .
JARGON
#-LRB- In a stock-index arbitrage sell program , traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference . -RRB-
JARGON
#But stocks kept falling .
JARGON
#I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things .
JARGON
#Under another post-crash system , Big Board President Richard Grasso -LRB- Mr. Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an inter-exchange hot line to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board .
JARGON
#He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board , where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders .
JARGON
#At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line .
JARGON
#But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .
JARGON
#At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again .
JARGON
#The release cautioned that there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 and that there are still attractive investment opportunities in the stock market .
JARGON
#And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading .
JARGON
#But there were no buyers .
JARGON
#At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks .
JARGON
#But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today .
JARGON
#The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation .
JARGON
#But the exchange will look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks .
JARGON
#But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the upstairs firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood-letting .
JARGON
#Mr. Phelan said , It will take another day or two to analyze who was buying and selling Friday .

#A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co. said it has made a $ 409 million cash bid for most of L.J. Hooker Corp. 's real-estate and shopping-center holdings .
JARGON
#The group is led by Jay Shidler , chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp. in Honolulu , and A. Boyd Simpson , chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc .
JARGON
#Mr. Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr. Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L.J. Hooker .
JARGON
#The assets are good , but they require more money and management than can be provided in L.J. Hooker 's current situation , said Mr. Simpson in an interview .
JARGON
#Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell .
JARGON
#We want to build and hold .
JARGON
#Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L.J. Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee .
JARGON
#Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co. , L.J. Hooker 's department-store chains .
JARGON
#The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati , the 800,000 square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia , S.C. , and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton , Colo .
JARGON
#Other Hooker properties included are a 20-story office tower in midtown Atlanta , expected to be completed next February ; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio ; L.J. Hooker International , the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate , plus other shopping centers .
JARGON
#We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , said Allan Campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett , in an interview .
JARGON
#Mr. Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc. , the Houston-based retailer , and Parisian Inc. , the Southeast department-store chain .
JARGON
#Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 .
JARGON
#Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain .
JARGON
#These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , said Mr. Shidler .

#And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week .
JARGON
#At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 .
JARGON
#Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , said C. Bruce Johnstone , who runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion Equity-Income Fund .
JARGON
#But fund managers say they 're ready .
JARGON
#Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year .
JARGON
#Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million .
JARGON
#One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September .
JARGON
#That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 .
JARGON
#But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said .
JARGON
#Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels .
JARGON
#Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday .
JARGON
#And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines .
JARGON
#If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg .
JARGON
#But most investors were seeking share prices and other information .
JARGON
#They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987 .
JARGON
#But most investors seemed to be in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , said Steven Norwitz , a vice president .
JARGON
#And Vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through .
JARGON
#Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits .
JARGON
#Elaine Garzarelli , who runs Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's $ 335 million Sector Analysis Portfolio , predicts the market will open down at least 50 points on technical factors and some panic selling .
JARGON
#But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs .
JARGON
#Half of them are really scared and want to sell , she said , but I 'm trying to talk them out of it .

#Peter Otradovec , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , has caused some turmoil in our scheduling and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines .
JARGON
#Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .
JARGON
#At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and Palmdale , Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries .
JARGON
#I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , Tom Baker , president of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday .
JARGON
#America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .
JARGON
#I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , Mr. Otradovec said .
JARGON
#Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time .
JARGON
#American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .
JARGON
#In Seattle , a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .
JARGON
#Meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's Everett , Wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout .
JARGON
#As of Friday , four had been delivered and a fifth plane , a 747-400 , was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China .
JARGON
#The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc .
JARGON
#But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week .
JARGON
#But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- very weak .
JARGON
#He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .
JARGON
#In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp. and the Calabasas , Calif. , aerospace company .
JARGON
#It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
JARGON
#-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $ 326 million .
JARGON
#A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike .

#Atco Ltd. said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars -LRB- US$ 851 million -RRB- , in Great Britain and elsewhere .
JARGON
#C.S. Richardson , Atco 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd. unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .
JARGON
#But we would n't go into them alone , and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said .
JARGON
#Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor .
JARGON
#Mr. Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding Atco 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities .
JARGON
#Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion -LRB- $ 31.05 billion -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month .
JARGON
#Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 .
JARGON
#Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers .
JARGON
#There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it .
JARGON
#We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator .
JARGON
#PSE Inc. said it expects to report third earnings of $ 1.3 million to $ 1.7 million , or 14 cents to 18 cents a share .

#The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50-50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp. , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp. , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif .
JARGON
#The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .
JARGON
#The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .
JARGON
#Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .
JARGON
#The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
JARGON
#But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting .
JARGON
#Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million .
JARGON
#And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them .
JARGON
#Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 .
JARGON
#Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction .
JARGON
#Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items .
JARGON
#But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .
JARGON
#Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents .
JARGON
#Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .
JARGON
#No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to haggle .
JARGON
#One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks .
JARGON
#But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance .
JARGON
#Two workers died and six remain in the hospital .
JARGON
#Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards .
JARGON
#When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward .
JARGON
#But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting .
JARGON
#You say you could have sold X percent of this product and Y percent of that , recalls Theodore Semegran , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer .
JARGON
#And then you still have to negotiate .
JARGON
#The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its ethylene production .
JARGON
#Asked about a bid for Quantum , a BP spokesman says , We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category .
JARGON
#A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money .
JARGON
#The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson .
JARGON
#The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .

#The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries .
JARGON
#Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community .
JARGON
#Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 .
JARGON
#Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 .
JARGON
#Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel .
JARGON
#It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments .
JARGON
#The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent .
JARGON
#But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 .
JARGON
#Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program .
JARGON
#The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela .
JARGON
#That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance .
JARGON
#These optional 1%-a-year increases to the steel quota program are built into the Bush administration 's steel-quota program to give its negotiators leverage with foreign steel suppliers to try to get them to withdraw subsidies and protectionism from their own steel industries .

#Elcotel Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a much stronger performance in its second half .
JARGON
#Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 .
JARGON
#George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million .
JARGON
#Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country .
JARGON
#Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data .
JARGON
#Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls .
JARGON
#The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings .

#While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. detergent market , where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders .
JARGON
#But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped .
JARGON
#P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .
JARGON
#But P&G contends the new Cheer is a unique formula that also offers an ingredient that prevents colors from fading .
JARGON
#And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space .
JARGON
#But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case .
JARGON
#Kao officials previously have said they are interested in selling detergents in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew Jergens Co. , a Cincinnati hand-lotion maker .
JARGON

JARGON
#With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills .
JARGON
#Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view .
JARGON
#He said such results should be measurable in dollars and cents in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan .
JARGON
#But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action .
JARGON
#She added that she expected perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest .
JARGON
#American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills .
JARGON
#But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic .
JARGON
#And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade .
JARGON
#Asked to compare her visit to Mr. Mosbacher 's , Mrs. Hills replied : I did n't hear every word he spoke , but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration .
JARGON
#I do n't feel either hard or soft .
JARGON
#I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade .
JARGON
#When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill .
JARGON
#But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition .
JARGON
#She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets .
JARGON
#But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity .
JARGON
#Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise .

#Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability .
JARGON
#The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance .
JARGON
#The industry is seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview .
JARGON
#That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings for the industry in general , he added .
JARGON
#But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies hard-hit by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings .
JARGON
#So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp .
JARGON
#Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand .
JARGON
#Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower .

#Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize .
JARGON
#Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter .
JARGON
#During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits .
JARGON
#Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter .

#Most of the Western European members of Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls , the unofficial forum through which the U.S. and its allies align their export-control policies , are expected to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting to be held in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 .
JARGON
#They plan to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high-technology products .
JARGON
#But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization .
JARGON
#A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details .
JARGON
#Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community .

#Financial Corp. of Santa Barbara filed suit against former stock speculator Ivan F. Boesky and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , charging they defrauded the thrift by concealing their relationship when persuading it to buy $ 284 million in high-yield , high-risk junk bonds .
JARGON
#Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million .
JARGON
#Officials at Drexel said they had n't seen the suit and thus could n't comment .
JARGON
#Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp. , the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels .
JARGON
#Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds .
JARGON
#Shortly before the visit , Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51 % stake in the company .
JARGON
#Financial Corp. purchased the bonds in at least 70 different transactions in 1984 and since then has realized $ 11 million in losses on them , the company said .

#While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their drought-induced peaks of 1988 , wheat prices remain stubbornly high .
JARGON
#And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say .
JARGON
#And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great Plains ' wheat-growing areas , yields in the crop now being planted could be reduced , further squeezing supplies .
JARGON
#In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments .
JARGON
#It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 .
JARGON
#But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year .
JARGON
#The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings .
JARGON
#Unseasonably hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great Plains and in wheat-growing areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said Conrad Leslie , a futures analyst and head of Leslie Analytical in Chicago .
JARGON
#For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture .
JARGON
#The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices .
JARGON
#Orange Juice Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go .
JARGON
#However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 .
JARGON
#Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time .
JARGON
#It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said .
JARGON
#Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said .

#Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets .
JARGON
#He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange .
JARGON
#Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes .
JARGON
#There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell .
JARGON
#Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria .
JARGON
#If a hostile predator emerges for Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , co-founders Charles and Maurice Saatchi will lead a management buy-out attempt , an official close to the company said .
JARGON
#Financing for any takeover attempt may be problematic in the wake of Friday 's stock-market sell-off in New York and turmoil in the junk-bond market .
JARGON
#But the beleaguered British advertising and consulting giant , which last week named a new chief executive officer to replace Maurice Saatchi , has been the subject of intense takeover speculation for weeks .
JARGON
#Last week , Saatchi 's largest shareholder , Southeastern Asset Management , said it had been approached by one or more third parties interested in a possible restructuring .
JARGON
#And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi .
JARGON
#The executive close to Saatchi & Saatchi said that if a bidder came up with a ludicrously high offer , a crazy offer which Saatchi knew it could n't beat , it would have no choice but to recommend it to shareholders .
JARGON
#But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back with an offer by management .
JARGON
#The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi .
JARGON
#Mr. Spielvogel is n't part of the board , nor are any of the other heads of Saatchi 's big U.S.-based ad agencies .
JARGON
#The executive did n't name any price , but securities analysts have said Saatchi would fetch upward of $ 1.3 billion .
JARGON
#That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 .
JARGON
#Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state .
JARGON
#It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel .
JARGON
#Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him .

JARGON
#Newspaper publishers are reporting mixed third-quarter results , aided by favorable newsprint prices and hampered by flat or declining advertising linage , especially in the Northeast .
JARGON
#Adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry .
JARGON
#In New York , the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , while the R.H. Macy & Co. , Bloomingdale 's and Saks Fifth Avenue department-store chains are for sale .
JARGON
#Until recently , industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters .
JARGON
#Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , said Edward J. Atorino , industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
JARGON
#For instance , Gannett Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates .
JARGON
#Gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue .
JARGON
#Total advertising linage was modestly lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was softer demand for retail and national ad linage , said John Curley , Gannett 's chief executive officer .
JARGON
#While USA Today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled 2,735 , a decrease of 4 % from last year , the paper 's ad revenue increased 8 % in the quarter and 13 % in the nine months .
JARGON
#In the nine months , Gannett 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ 1.68 a share , from $ 247 million , or $ 1.52 a share .
JARGON
#Net fell to $ 28.8 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share .
JARGON
#The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share .
JARGON
#The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine .
JARGON
#The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $ 8.5 million , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 26.5 million , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 .
JARGON
#William O. Taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer , said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the Boston newspaper .
JARGON
#Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers .
JARGON
#New York Times Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , Forest Products Group .
JARGON
#Times Co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market , said Alan Kassan , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton .
JARGON
#Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area .
JARGON
#The news-weekly has faced heightened competition from rival Time magazine and a relatively flat magazine advertising market .
JARGON
#Knight-Ridder Inc. is faced with continued uncertainty over the pending joint operating agreement between its Detroit Free Press and Gannett 's Detroit News , and has told analysts that earnings were down in the third quarter .
JARGON
#However , analysts point to positive advertising spending at several of its major daily newspapers , such as the Miami Herald and San Jose Mercury News .
JARGON
#The Miami market is coming back strong after a tough couple of years when Knight-Ridder was starting up a Hispanic edition and circulation was falling , said Bruce Thorp , an analyst for Provident National Bank .

#General Motors Corp. , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U.S. and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .
JARGON
#In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U.S. car factories .
JARGON
#GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
JARGON
#The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed disarray and an inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , Mr. Yokich said .
JARGON
#That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .
JARGON
#The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio .
JARGON
#Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
JARGON
#But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U.S. car plants and one in Quebec .
JARGON
#Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
JARGON
#GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .
JARGON
#That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .
JARGON
#At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and none of us knows when the A-body cars will die .

#Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of net benefit to Canada .
JARGON
#Both Merieux and Connaught are biotechnology research and vaccine manufacturing concerns .
JARGON
#He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed .
JARGON
#This is n't a change in government policy ; this provision has been used before , said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology .
JARGON
#Spokesmen for Merieux and Connaught said they had n't been informed of specific areas of concern by either the government or Investment Canada , but added they hope to have more information early this week .

JARGON
#Additionally , the company said it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the proposed offering of 10 million shares of common stock , expected to be offered in November .
JARGON
#The company said Salomon Brothers Inc. and Howard , Weil , Labouisse , Friedrichs Inc. , underwriters for the offering , were granted an option to buy as much as an additional 1.5 million shares to cover over-allotments .
JARGON

JARGON
#Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins .
JARGON
#Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines .
JARGON
#Joseph Riccardo , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs .
JARGON
#Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % .
JARGON
#Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication .
JARGON
#In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ 311.8 million , or 79 cents a share .
JARGON
#In last year 's third quarter , Lilly earned $ 171.4 million , or $ 1.20 a share .
JARGON
#Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ 87.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year .
JARGON
#The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins .
JARGON
#Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease .
JARGON
#Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because those companies are really managed well .
JARGON
#ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share , while Bristol-Myers earned $ 232.3 million , or 81 cents a share , in the like period a year earlier .
JARGON
#Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition .
JARGON
#In the third quarter last year , Pfizer earned $ 216.8 million , or $ 1.29 a share .
JARGON
#Analysts said they expected Upjohn 's profit to be flat or rise by only about 2 % to 4 % as compared with $ 89.6 million , or 49 cents a share , it earned a year ago .
JARGON
#Upjohn 's biggest-selling drugs are Xanax , a tranquilizer , and Halcion , a sedative .
JARGON
#Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs .
JARGON
#Also , the company 's hair-growing drug , Rogaine , is selling well -- at about $ 125 million for the year , but the company 's profit from the drug has been reduced by Upjohn 's expensive print and television campaigns for advertising , analysts said .

#Many of the nation 's highest-ranking executives saluted Friday 's market plunge as an overdue comeuppance for speculators and takeover players .
JARGON
#Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating .
JARGON
#The executives were remarkably unperturbed by the plunge even though it lopped billions of dollars off the value of their companies -- and millions off their personal fortunes .
JARGON
#I 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , said Kenneth Olsen , Digital Equipment Corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 .
JARGON
#The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this wo n't be a problem .
JARGON
#Of course , established corporate managements often tend to applaud the setbacks of stock speculators and takeover artists .
JARGON
#Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump .
JARGON
#Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate , Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said : No comment .

#Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , said Lewis Preston , chairman of J.P.

#The real estate slump that 's pushing down the price of New York office space and housing is also affecting the city 's retail real estate market .

#In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill .

#Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .
JARGON
#A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents .
JARGON
#And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau .
JARGON
#But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say .
JARGON
#As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc .
JARGON
#He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .
JARGON
#In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined .
JARGON
#It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt .

JARGON
#Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways .
JARGON
#Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad .
JARGON
#But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases .
JARGON
#But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech .
JARGON
#Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , he said .
JARGON
#Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was depressed about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights .
JARGON
#We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , he said in a speech last month .
JARGON
#Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , he says .
JARGON
#Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years .
JARGON
#And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August .
JARGON
#But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago .
JARGON
#He concluded his remarks by quoting , emotionally and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin Luther King 's famous I Have a Dream speech from the 1963 March on Washington .
JARGON
#Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others .

#The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created .

#Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of wooing new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its subscription rates and cutting back on merchandise giveaways .
JARGON
#In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will dramatically de-emphasize its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives ; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 .
JARGON
#Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers .
JARGON
#In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers .
JARGON
#Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies .
JARGON
#But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .
JARGON
#Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers .
JARGON
#What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , said Mr. Heinemann .
JARGON
#We are trying to create quality and involvement .
JARGON
#And Time 's paid circulation , according to Audit Bureau of Circulations , dropped 7.3 % to 4,393,237 in the six months ended June 30 , 1989 .
JARGON
#Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away .
JARGON
#Time 's rivals news-weeklies , Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report , are less reliant on electronic giveaways , and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases .

JARGON
#Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- .
JARGON
#So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a top of mind network .
JARGON
#The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier , a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism .
JARGON
#To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program .
JARGON
#It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers .
JARGON
#And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team .
JARGON
#But that wo n't be easy .
JARGON
#It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see .
JARGON
#And the cable-TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are .
JARGON
#The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive .
JARGON
#Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future .
JARGON
#In addition , many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations .
JARGON
#Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping grazers and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research .
JARGON
#The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels .
JARGON
#It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .
JARGON
#It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called Daybreak , Daywatch , Newsday , and Newsnight , but the shows varied little in content , personality or look .
JARGON
#And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its Larry King Live and Crossfire talk shows , which executives hope will keep people tuned in .
JARGON
#Then there 's The World Today , the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier .
JARGON
#But 70 % of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so CNN wants in .
JARGON
#I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report .
JARGON
#CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks .

#September 's steep rise in producer prices shows that inflation still persists , and the pessimism over interest rates caused by the new price data contributed to the stock market 's plunge Friday .
JARGON
#That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
JARGON
#But economists were divided over the extent of the inflation threat signaled by the new numbers .
JARGON
#The overall 0.9 % increase is serious in itself , but what is even worse is that excluding food and energy , the producer price index still increased by 0.7 % , said Gordon Richards , an economist at the National Association of Manufacturers .
JARGON
#But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump .
JARGON
#Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated .
JARGON
#But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise is n't as bad an omen as the 0.9 % figure suggests .
JARGON
#If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , he explained .

JARGON
#He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September .
JARGON
#Accordingly , CityFed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter .

#City Federal operates 105 banking offices in New Jersey and Florida .
JARGON

JARGON
#He added , however : Depending on the resolution of certain accounting issues relating to mortgages servicing and the outcome of the annual examination of City Federal currently in progress with respect to the appropriate level of loan loss reserves , the total loss for the quarter could significantly exceed this range .

#In a statement , Miami-based CenTrust said the regulators cited the thrift 's operating losses and apparent losses in its junk-bond portfolio in ordering the suspension of the dividends .
JARGON
#David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , which issued the directive , saying it was inappropriate and based on insufficient reasons .
JARGON
#In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a troubled institution , largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses .
JARGON
#Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
JARGON
#The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market .
JARGON
#CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds .
JARGON
#The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market .
JARGON
#Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market .
JARGON
#In a statement Friday , Mr. Paul challenged the regulators ' decision , saying the thrift 's operating losses and apparent junk-bond losses have been substantially offset by gains in other activities of the bank .
JARGON
#Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now .
JARGON
#Branches and deposits can be sold at a premium in the event federal regulators take over an institution .
JARGON
#CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion .
JARGON
#It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards .
JARGON
#Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .
JARGON
#The thrift is also working to unload its junk-bond portfolio by continuing to sell off the bonds , and it plans to eventually place some of them in a separate affiliate , as required under the new thrift law .

JARGON
#But not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged cheap-to-make talk and game shows , while discouraging expensive-to-produce dramas .
JARGON
#Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
JARGON
#The result is a new and huge appetite for programming .
JARGON

#British Aerospace PLC and France 's Thomson-CSF S.A. said they are nearing an agreement to merge their guided-missile divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .

#After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance .

#The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe 's defense industry .

#But neither Matra nor GEC -- unrelated to Stamford , Conn.-based General Electric Co. -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .
JARGON
#Yesterday , a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight , as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF .
JARGON
#Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra , Britain 's Dowty Group PLC , West Germany 's Daimler-Benz AG , and France 's Dassault group .
JARGON
#But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated .
JARGON
#Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators ; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry .
JARGON
#A consortium bid , however , would diminish GEC 's direct role in Ferranti and might consequently appease ministry officials .

#Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate .
JARGON
#The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc .
JARGON
#Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s .
JARGON
#Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly .
JARGON
#The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group .
JARGON
#Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada , and almost 60 % of Interprovincial 's total volume consists of light crude .
JARGON
#Nearly all of the crude oil that Canada exports to the U.S. is transported on Interprovincial 's system , whose main line runs from Edmonton to major U.S. and Canadian cities in the Great Lakes region , including Chicago , Buffalo , Toronto and Montreal .
JARGON
#Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation .
JARGON
#That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico .

#But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it , he said .

#Inland Steel Industries Inc. expects to report that third-quarter earnings dropped more than 50 % from the previous quarter as a result of reduced sales volume and increased costs .
JARGON
#In the second quarter , the steelmaker had net income of $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share , including a pretax charge of $ 17 million related to the settlement of a suit , on sales of $ 1.11 billion .
JARGON
#The company said normal seasonal softness and lost orders caused by prolonged labor talks reduced shipments by 200,000 tons in the latest quarter , compared with the second quarter .
JARGON
#At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract .
JARGON
#The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit .
JARGON
#The company said it is beginning to see some shipping-rate improvements in both the intergrated-steel and steel-service-center segments , which should result in improved results for the fourth quarter .
JARGON
#In the year-earlier third quarter , when the industry was in the midst of a boom , the company had net of $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , on sales of $ 1.02 billion .
JARGON
#Take Microsoft Corp. , the largest maker of personal computer software and generally considered an industry bellwether .
JARGON
#But that was all of three months ago .
JARGON
#To illustrate , Mr. Rogers said that of the 14 computer-related firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results .
JARGON
#Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co. , Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past .
JARGON
#In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share .
JARGON
#In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .
JARGON
#Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled .
JARGON
#Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach , and analysts say they are likely to carry IBM , the biggest seller of personal computers , along with them .
JARGON
#It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , said Russ Crabs , an analyst at Soundview Financial Group .

#Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their brains , are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes .
JARGON
#As a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses H-P , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own .
JARGON

#So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan .
JARGON
#Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says .
JARGON
#Between 1987 and 1988 , North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population , a loss of 4,000 people .
JARGON
#Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin .
JARGON
#And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again .
JARGON
#At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround .
JARGON
#Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska .
JARGON
#Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest , and fast-growing states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue .
JARGON
#But the growth gap between the Sun Belt and other regions has clearly started narrowing .
JARGON
#And even after losing a spouse , more of the elderly are staying independent .
JARGON
#But even among those aged 75 and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to 40 % in 1988 from 38 % in 1970 .
JARGON
#Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 .
JARGON
#More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially .
JARGON
#MANY AFFLUENT people place personal success and money above family .

JARGON
#Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it .

#Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool .
JARGON
#Mayor Lynn Spruill and two members of the council said they were worried about setting a precedent that would permit pool halls along Addison 's main street .
JARGON
#And the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Prof. Hill 's , warned that alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights .
JARGON
#Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where upscale , suit-and-tie places are adding tables .
JARGON
#With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , people do n't want to just sit around and drink .

#A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City .
JARGON
#Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason , the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights -LRB- 9:30-10 p.m. EDT -RRB- .
JARGON
#Not only is Mr. Mason the star of Chicken Soup , he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to Duck Soup , and he 's currently a man in hot water .
JARGON
#Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company .
JARGON
#As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular .
JARGON
#He said Jews were sick with complexes ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , a fancy shvartze with a mustache .
JARGON
#It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language .
JARGON
#These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group , such as Polish jokes ; and the type that is double-edged , aiming inward as well as outward .
JARGON
#The latter typically is the humor of the underdog , and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves .
JARGON
#In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons .
JARGON
#But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .
JARGON
#Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict .
JARGON
#That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
JARGON
#The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ?
JARGON
#Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy .
JARGON
#But these are not the differences that make headlines .
JARGON
#In Chicken Soup , Mr. Mason plays Jackie , a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie -LRB- Lynn Redgrave -RRB- , an Irish widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother -LRB- Rita Karin -RRB- and her brother Michael -LRB- Brandon Maggart -RRB- .
JARGON
#At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie .
JARGON
#And a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Nation of Islam .
JARGON
#Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of Abie 's Irish Rose made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain .
JARGON
#And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called Bridget Loves Bernie , whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .
JARGON
#Clearly , the question with Chicken Soup is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all .
JARGON
#So far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
JARGON
#For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker .
JARGON
#Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona .
JARGON
#The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself .
JARGON
#But too often , these routines lack spark because this sitcom , like all sitcoms , is timid about confronting Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences .
JARGON
#But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about caring for other people that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America .
JARGON

#Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases .
JARGON
#But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut .
JARGON
#House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .
JARGON
#But , he added , I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year .
JARGON
#The Senate 's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year .
JARGON
#And a senior aide to the House Ways and Means Committee , where tax legislation originates , said there are n't any plans to produce another tax bill that could carry a gains tax cut this year .
JARGON
#One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit .
JARGON
#Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate .
JARGON
#But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the streamlined bill .
JARGON
#These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures .
JARGON
#One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts .

#Here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do .
JARGON
#I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , says Mr. Granville , once a widely followed market guru and still a well-known newsletter writer .
JARGON
#Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .
JARGON
#Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out .
JARGON
#This was an October massacre like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 .
JARGON
#So she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .
JARGON
#Those corrections lasted one to four weeks and took the market 10%-12 % down , she says .
JARGON
#She says that ratio could climb to 14.5 , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of fair value .
JARGON
#But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no 1987-style crash .
JARGON
#We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again .
JARGON
#I do n't think that 's the case at all , says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management .
JARGON
#Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush .
JARGON
#I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability .
JARGON
#He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
JARGON
#And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of overheating .
JARGON
#But the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits is n't good , he says .
JARGON
#If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying .
JARGON
#But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying on behalf of clients .
JARGON
#The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity .
JARGON
#This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable .
JARGON
#It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try .
JARGON
#These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue .
JARGON
#He thinks another crash is unlikely , and says he was nibbling at selected stocks during Friday 's plunge .
JARGON
#It seems to me that this is the pin that has finally pricked the balloon , says Mr. Rogers , a professor of finance at Columbia University and former co-manager of one of the most successful hedge funds in history , Quantum Fund .
JARGON
#Dealers would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade .
JARGON
#If the dollar stays weak , he says , that will add to inflationary pressures in the U.S. and make it hard for the Federal Reserve Board to ease interest rates very much .
JARGON
#Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go .
JARGON
#He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
JARGON
#Stock prices would still have to go down some additional amount before we become positive on stocks , says Mr. Terrizzi , president and managing director of Renaissance Investment Management Inc. in Cincinnati .
JARGON
#Renaissance , which manages about $ 1.8 billion , drew stiff criticism from many clients earlier this year because it pulled entirely out of stocks at the beginning of the year and thus missed a strong rally .
JARGON
#Regarding the Oct. 3 letter to the editor from Rep. Tom Lantos , chairman of the House Subcommittee on Employment and Housing , alleging :
JARGON
#1 . That your Sept. 28 editorial Kangaroo Committees was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
JARGON
#I thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately elucidative .
JARGON
#As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment .
JARGON
#My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc .
JARGON
#By any reasonable man criterion , Mr. Lantos and his colleagues have a whole bunch of people tried and convicted .
JARGON
#But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ?
JARGON
#Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ?
JARGON
#Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ?
JARGON
#4 . That the Journal defends the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place while Mr. Pierce was secretary of HUD , etc. and so forth .
JARGON
#No , to my mind , the Journal did not defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ...
JARGON
#it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense .
JARGON
#The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body .
JARGON
#But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate .
JARGON
#Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to take the Fifth .
JARGON
#The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause .
JARGON
#Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter .
JARGON
#He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
JARGON
#Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .
JARGON
#The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime .
JARGON
#It was Friday the 13th , and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points .
JARGON
#Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ?
JARGON
#In academia , a so-called Friday the 13th effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .
JARGON
#Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th .
JARGON
#But their study , which spanned the 1962-85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data .
JARGON
#But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore .
JARGON
#In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity .
JARGON
#reminiscent of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered .
JARGON
#Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .
JARGON
#Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 .
JARGON
#By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % .
JARGON
#On Oct. 16 , 1987 , the Nasdaq Composite fell 16.18 points , or 3.8 % , followed by its devastating 46.12-point , or 11 % slide , three days later .
JARGON
#Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades .
JARGON
#The subject is a sore one for Nasdaq and its market-making companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash .
JARGON
#There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots .
JARGON
#But , he added , you can only take one call at a time .
JARGON
#When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast .
JARGON
#But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand .
JARGON
#Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit .
JARGON
#Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent .
JARGON
#But they are worried .
JARGON

JARGON
#Rightly or wrongly , many giant institutional investors appear to be fighting the latest war by applying the lesson they learned in the October 1987 crash : Buying at the bottom pays off .
JARGON
#They could still panic and bail out of the market .
JARGON
#But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .
JARGON
#Last time , we got rewarded for going out and buying stocks when the panic was the worst , said John W. Rogers , president of Chicago-based Ariel Capital Management Inc. , which manages $ 1.1 billion of stocks .

#I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn .
JARGON
#Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock .
JARGON
#The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif .

#You could go down 400 points and still have a good year in the market , said James D. Awad , president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp .

#Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .
JARGON
#He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading .

#Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman Willard Butcher is a conservative banker and a loyal Republican , but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making .
JARGON
#I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't .
JARGON
#But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy .
JARGON
#The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill .
JARGON
#We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said yesterday on NBC News 's Meet the Press .
JARGON
#-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy .
JARGON
#One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's This Week .
JARGON
#But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision .
JARGON
#And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC .
JARGON
#Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold .
JARGON
#And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous .
JARGON
#The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .
JARGON
#But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year .
JARGON
#Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented .
JARGON
#One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble .
JARGON
#But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy .
JARGON
#There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- .
JARGON
#Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight .
JARGON
#Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation .
JARGON
#There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said yesterday on CBS News 's Face the Nation .
JARGON
#During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds .
JARGON
#Friday 's market tumble could spur action on reconciling the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the soonest .
JARGON
#Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit .
JARGON
#The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday .
JARGON
#The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion .
JARGON
#Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : We 're getting very close to the margins here .
JARGON
#But some players were quick to seize the moment .
JARGON
#There have been many preposterous reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others .
JARGON
#The following U.S. Treasury , corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week , according to Dow Jones Capital Markets Report :

#Small investors matched their big institutional brethren in anxiety over the weekend , but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market .
JARGON
#But he 's not so sure about everyone else .
JARGON
#I think on Monday the small -LRB- investors -RRB- are going to panic and sell , predicted Mr. Sullivan , whose investments include AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and several mutual funds .

#Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more .
JARGON
#But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .
JARGON
#Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .
JARGON
#Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it .
JARGON
#I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , she says , that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it .
JARGON
#She and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the 1987 crash , although she still owns some Texaco stock .
JARGON
#Partly because of concern about the economy and partly because she recently quit her job as a legal assistant to go to school , I think at this point we want to be a lot more liquid .

#Discount brokerage customers have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago , says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm .
JARGON
#But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried .
JARGON
#Alan Helfman , general sales manager of a Chrysler dealership in Houston , said he and his mother have some joint stock investments , but the overall economy is his chief worry .

JARGON
#And , finally , there were the gloaters .
JARGON
#Everything , said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office .
JARGON
#Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially Zenith Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a swarm of promising start-ups .
JARGON
#One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller palmtops .
JARGON
#But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match .
JARGON
#Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 .
JARGON
#All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases .
JARGON
#In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly .
JARGON
#Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to read block printing .
JARGON
#At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .
JARGON
#Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs .
JARGON
#Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much .
JARGON
#Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter .
JARGON
#Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
JARGON
#Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq .
JARGON
#Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like Dynabook Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel 286 microprocessor and has a hard disk drive .
JARGON
#But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's .
JARGON
#Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker .
JARGON
#Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $ 635 million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales .
JARGON
#Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an unconventional two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk .
JARGON
#I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc .
JARGON
#Compaq 's machines include the 3 1\/2-inch floppy disk drive , a backlit screen that is only 1\/4-inch thick and an internal expansion slot for a modem -- in other words , almost all the capabilities of a typical office machine .
JARGON
#Others undoubtedly will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition .
JARGON
#Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size .
JARGON
#A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players .
JARGON
#International Business Machines Corp. , analysts say , has been burned twice in trying to enter the laptop market and shows no signs of trying to get into notebooks anytime soon .
JARGON
#Honeywell Inc. and International Business Machines Corp. received Air Force contracts to develop integrated circuits for use in space .

#Jaguar , the London Stock Exchange and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are being notified of the transactions , the company said .
JARGON
#That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
JARGON

#The Garden City , N.Y. , car-rental company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and Midway Airlines at the end of this year .
JARGON
#But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines .
JARGON
#Industry estimates put Avis 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million .
JARGON
#A spokesman for Avis would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total .
JARGON
#Budget Rent a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car Rental Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit .
JARGON
#In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn frequent-flier miles and fliers can get car-rental discounts .
JARGON
#I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning .
JARGON
#Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements .
JARGON
#National also participates in the Northwest frequent-flier program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit .
JARGON
#A month ago , Hertz , of Park Ridge , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that pacts with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 .
JARGON
#At the time , Hertz said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed awards topped $ 15 million .
JARGON
#Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
JARGON
#Robert D. Cardillo , Avis vice president of marketing , said , The proliferation and costs attached to -LCB- frequent-flier programs -RCB- have significantly diminished their value .
JARGON
#This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons .
JARGON
#They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly sensible way to do it , he said .

#Tandem Computers Inc. , preparing to fight with International Business Machines Corp. for a piece of the mainframe business , said it expects to post higher revenue and earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30 .
JARGON
#Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $ 450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
JARGON
#In the year-earlier period , Tandem reported net income of $ 30.1 million , or 31 cents a share , on revenue of $ 383.9 million .
JARGON
#Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino , Calif. , company will report revenue of $ 430 million to $ 460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share .
JARGON
#Tandem makes fault-tolerant computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems .
JARGON
#But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines .
JARGON
#The answer is n't price reductions , but new systems , he said .
JARGON
#It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .
JARGON
#The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy .
JARGON
#Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy .
JARGON
#Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance .
JARGON
#But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
JARGON
#But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
JARGON
#That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. .
JARGON
#Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting .
JARGON
#Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- but only slightly and for a short period of time , recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles .
JARGON
#-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected .
JARGON
#Today , he frets , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices sink this week and if consumers retrench in reaction .
JARGON
#But , in the process , the Fed risks reigniting inflation .
JARGON
#Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations .
JARGON
#The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors .
JARGON
#A 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .
JARGON
#And if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it .
JARGON
#Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression .
